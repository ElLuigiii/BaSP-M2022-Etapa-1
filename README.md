# Trackgenix
  Descripcion:
  
- The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services 
to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that 
we will call "Trackgenix" that facilitates the registration of hours 
worked by each employee in each project and work team.
The system has a main screen (Landing) with different sections. 
There it is explained which are the characteristics of the system.


How to open
- Open terminal
- Go to the directory where to clone the repository
- write the following command: 
$ git clone https://github.com/ElLuigiii/Week-3

### Week 02

``Create an HTML document that has the same content as the landing
of the screenflow of the first week, using the desktop version, 
and adding all the content that is visible both in this version and 
in the other versions (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.)
respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository.
``
### Week 03
``
The problem of week 03 consists of including the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of week 02 to ensure that when viewing the page, it looks identical to the landing of the screenflow of the first week.
