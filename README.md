# Trackgenix
  Descripcion:
  
- The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services 
to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that 
we will call "Trackgenix" that facilitates the registration of hours 
worked by each employee in each project and work team.
The system has a main screen (Landing) with different sections. 
There it is explained which are the characteristics of the system.


How to open
- Open terminal
- Go to the directory where to clone the repository
- write the following command: 
$ git clone https://github.com/ElLuigiii/BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1

How to view in Github Pages
-Go to "https://elluigiii.github.io/BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1/"
-Write at the end to url the week to work

### Week 02

``Create an HTML document that has the same content as the landing
of the screenflow of the first week, using the desktop version, 
and adding all the content that is visible both in this version and 
in the other versions (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.)
respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository.
``
### Week 03
``
The problem of week 03 consists of including the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of week 02 to ensure that when viewing the page, it looks identical to the landing of the screenflow of the first week.
``
### Week 04
``
The objective of week 04 is to replicate the landing page of the full week 03 screenflow using Flexbox as the main tool for creating a Responsive Design following the concept of Mobile First. The main menu should be located in the left sidebar with links when viewed from a desktop PC, but when viewing the web from a cell phone the vertical bar should disappear and only the “hamburger” icon ☰ should be displayed. This landing has to be seen perfectly on any device. The navigation menu does not need to lead anywhere.
``
### Week 05
``
The problem of week 05 consists of doing the JavaScript exercises provided at the end of this document, applying the concepts learned from the asynchronous material. We will find these exercises located in the Excercises folder and we can see them in the index console.
``
### Week 07
``
In each form an HTTP request must be made using the Fetch method of Javascript, sending all the data loaded in the form. The request should only be executed if all form validations pass; if any field does not meet the validations, the request should not be made.
