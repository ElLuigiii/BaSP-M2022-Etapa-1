# Week 5

Description: 

By performing the JavaScript exercises provided at the end of this document, applying the concepts learned from the asynchronous material.
Each exercise block should be saved in a new JS file inside a folder called “exercises” and this folder should be saved in the repository. 
## Excercises:
 ### 1 - Variables y Operadores

a)Create two numeric variables and use the addition operator to store the value of the sum of both numbers in a 3rd variable.

b)Create two variables of type String and concatenate them saving the result in a 3rd variable.

c)Create two variables of type String and add the length of each variable (number of letters in the string) saving the result of the addition in a 3rd variable (use length).

### 2 - Strings
a)Create a variable of type string with at least 10 characters and convert all text to uppercase (use toUpperCase).

b)Create a variable of type string with at least 10 characters and generate a new string with the first 5 characters saving the result in a new variable (use substring).

c)Create a variable of type string with at least 10 characters and generate a new string with the last 3 characters saving the result in a new variable (use substring).

d)Create a variable of type string with at least 10 characters and generate a new string with the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase. Save the result in a new variable (use substring, toUpperCase, toLowerCase and the + operator).

e)Create a variable of type string with at least 10 characters and some white space. Find the position of the first white space and store it in a variable (use indexOf)

f)Create a variable of type string with at least 2 words long (10 characters and some space in between). Use the methods from the previous exercises to generate a new string that has the first letter of both words in uppercase and the other letters in lowercase (use indexOf, substring, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, and the + operator).

### 3 - Arrays 
a)Given the following array: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"] show by console the months 5 and 11 (use console.log).

b)Ordenar el array de meses alfabéticamente y mostrarlo por consola (utilizar sort).

c)Add an element to the beginning and end of the array (use unshift and push).

d)Remove an element from the beginning and the end of the array (use shift and pop).

e)Reverse the order of the array (use reverse).

f)Join all the elements of the array into a single string where each month is separated by a hyphen - (use join).

g)Create a copy of the month array containing May through November (use slice).

### 4 -If Else
a)Create a random number between 0 and 1 using the Math.random() function, if the value is greater than or equal to 0.5, display an alert with the message “Greater than 0.5” and if not, an alert with the message “Lower than 0.5”.
b)Create a variable “Age” that contains an integer between 0 and 100 and displays the following alert messages:

- “Baby” if the age is less than 2 years;

- “Child” if the age is between 2 and 12 years;

- “Adolescent” between 13 and 19 years old;

- “Young” between 20 and 30 years old;

- “Adult” between 31 and 60 years old;

- “Senior Adult” between 61 and 75 years old;

- “Elderly” if he is older than 75 years.


### 5 - For
a)Create an array containing 5 words and iterate through that array using a JavaScript for loop to display an alert using each of the words.

b)Al array anterior convertir la primera letra de cada palabra en mayúscula y mostrar una alerta por cada palabra modificada.

c)Create a variable called “sentence” that has an empty string, then go through the array from point a) with a for loop to save each word inside the sentence variable. At the end show a single alert with the complete chain.

d)Create an empty array and with a for loop of 10 repetitions. Fill the array with the repetition number, that is, at the end of the execution of the for loop there should be 10 elements inside the array, from number 0 to number 9. Show the final array in the browser console (use console .log).

### 6 - Functions
a)Create a sum function that receives two numerical values ​​and returns the result. Execute the function and save the result in a variable, displaying the value of said variable in the browser console.

b)To the previous sum function, add a validation to check if any of the parameters is not a number, display an alert clarifying that one of the parameters has an error and return the NaN value as the result

c)Create a validate integer function that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if it's an integer.

d)To the sum function of exercise 6b) add a call that validates that the numbers are integers. If there are decimals, display an alert with the error and return the number converted to an integer (rounded).

e)Convert the validation from exercise 6d) into a separate function and call it inside the sum function testing that everything still works the same.
